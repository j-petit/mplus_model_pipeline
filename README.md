## MPlus Structural Equation Modelling tools
The scripts facilitate the exploration of different Structural Equation Model (SEM) using the mplus tool. The model is first parsed from the textfile into a datastructure which is then modified depending on differences between two groups.  

This is still work-in-progress.

## User manual:
